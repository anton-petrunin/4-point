\begin{abstract}
We study the effect on metric spaces imposed by quadratic inequalities on the six distances between points in every quadruple.
\end{abstract}

\paragraph{Quadratic inequality.}\label{par:quadratic-inq}
Suppose $a_{i,j}$ are components of a symmetric $n{\times}n$ matrix.
We are interested in length spaces $X$ that
satisfy the inequalities of the following type
\[\sum_{i,j}a_{i,j}\cdot|x_i-x_j|_X^2\ge 0\]
for any $n$-point array $\bm{x}\z=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ in $X$.

The inequality of this type will be called \emph{quadratic}.


Nonnegative and nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov can be described by inequalities of that type for $n=4$.
Namely they are described by the so-called inequalities of negative type $(3,1)$ and $(2,2)$ respectively.
It motivated us to investigate the whole class of these inequalies.

Our paper contains several simple observations, but all together they form something interesting, and they open ground for further investigations.
We certainly want to tackle the case $n>4$, but first we need to thoroughly grasp the simplest case $n=4$, which is exactly what we are trying to do.

\paragraph{Associated form.}\label{Associated form}
Let $\bm{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ be a point array in a metric space, and let $V\z=\RR^{n-1}$.
Choose once for all a nondegenerate simplex $\triangle$ in $V$,
we may assume that its vertices $v_i$ for $i<n$ form a standard basis, and $v_n=0$.
Consider quadratic form $\rho_{\bm{x}}$ on $V$ that satisfies the following equalities
\[\rho_{\bm{x}}(v_i-v_j)=|x_i-x_j|^2_X\] 
for all $i$ and $j$.

The quadratic form $\rho_{\bm{x}}$ will bne called the \emph{associated form} of $\bm{x}=(x_1,\z\dots,x_n)$;
it is uniquely defined and remembers all distances $|x_i-x_j|_X$
(we assume that the simplex $\triangle$ in $V$ is known).

The space of quadratic forms over $V$ will be denoted by $W$;
it is the symmetric square of $V^*$, and can be written as $W=S^2(V^*)$.
The quadratic inequalities described above define linear inequalities on $W$,
and the class of spaces that we are going to consider can be described the following way.

Let $K$ be a convex cone in $W$;
that is, $K$ is a nonempty set such that if $v,w\in K$, then $a\cdot v+b\cdot w\in K$ for any $a,b\ge0$.
Denote by $\mathcal{M}_K$ the class of all length spaces $X$ such that
$\rho_{\bm{x}}\in K$ for any $n$-point array $\bm{x}\z=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ in $X$.

Suppose $X,Y\in  \mathcal{M}_K$ and $a\ge 0$.
Since $K$ is convex,  $X\times Y$ and $a\cdot X$ are in $\mathcal{M}_K$;
here $X\times Y$ denotes $\ell_2$-product of metric spaces, and 
$a\cdot X$ denotes the rescaled copy of of $X$ with factor $a$. 

The last observation can be used in the opposite direction as well.
It gives that all forms $\rho_{\bm{x}}$ for point arrays in $\mathcal{M}_K$-spaces form a convex cone, say $K'$.

Evidently $K'\subset K$.
This inclusion might be strict.
First reason comes form the triangle inequality, which is equivalent to $\rho_{\bm{x}}(w)\ge 0$ for any vector $w$ in a 2-face of $\triangle$.
These inequalities must hold for any form in $K'$.
Furthermore, if $\rho_{\bm{x}}\in K'$, then $\rho_{\bm{y}}\in K'$ for any $n$-point array $\bm{y}$ made from the points of $\bm{x}$; in particular $\bm{y}$ might be a permutation of points in $\bm{x}$.

These two conditions work for all metrics (not necessary intrinsic),
and one cannot get more for general metric spaces.
The next observation already use length-metricness.

\begin{thm}{Observation}
If $K$ is closed convex cone in $W$.
Then $K'$ is closed.
Moreover, $\mathcal{M}_K$ closed under ultralimits.
\end{thm}


(For \emph{ultralimits} and \emph{ultracompletions} of metric spaces and all related topics, see, for example, \cite{petrunin2023}.)

\parit{Proof.}
The last statement is evident, and it implies the first statement.

Indeed, for any sequence of spaces $X_n$ in $\mathcal{M}_K$, its ultralimit $X_\omega$ also belongs to $\mathcal{M}_K$.
Therefore, given a sequence of point arrays $\bm{x}_n$ in $X_n$,
its limit $\bm{x}_\omega$ in $X_\omega$ has limit distances between corresponding points.
Hence the result.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $K$ be a closed convex cone in $W$ such that $K=K'$.
If $K$ is nontrival (that is, $K\ne \{0\}$), then $\mathcal{M}_K$ contains all Euclidean spaces.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Since $K$ is nontrival, $\mathcal{M}_K$ contains a space, say $X$, with two distinct points.
Consider the ultracompletion $X^\omega$ of $X$;
recall that $X$ can be (and will be) considered as a subset of $X^\omega$.
Since $K$ is closed, the observation implies that $X^\omega\in \mathcal{M}_K$.

Since  $X$ is a length space, $X^\omega$ has to be geodesic.
Since $X^\omega$ contains pair of distinct point, it must contain a nontrivial geodesic.
It follows that $\mathcal{M}_K$ contains a line segment.
Rescaling the seqment and passing to the ultralimit, we get $\RR\in \mathcal{M}_K$;
passing to the products of $\RR$, we get the result. 
\qeds

Let us denote by $Q$ the cone of nonnegative quadratic forms in $W$.
Its dual cone $Q^*\subset W^*=S^2(V)$ is the space of generated by tensor squares of vectors in $V$. 

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $K$ be a closed convex cone in $W$ such that $K=K'$.
Then either $K\supset Q$ or $K$ is the trivial; that is, $K=\{0\}$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Since $\RR\in \mathcal{M}_K$, we get that $\ell^2\in K$ for any linear function $\ell\:V\to\RR$.
By the spectral theorem, any form in $Q$ can be written as a sum of squares of linear functions, hence the result.
\qeds

\paragraph{Rank-one inequalities.}\label{par:rank-one}
Recall that $\rho_{\bm{x}}$ denotes the associated quadratic form for a given point array $\bm{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$.

\begin{thm}{Observation}
A given point array $\bm{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ is isometric to an array in a Euclidean space if and only if $\rho_{\bm{x}}(v)\ge 0$ for any vector $v$.
\end{thm}

An inequality of type $\rho_{\bm{x}}(v)\ge 0$ for a fixed vector $v\in V$ will be called rank-one inequality.

It is a partial case of quadratic inequality.
In the notations of §\ref{par:quadratic-inq}, it means that $a_{i,j}=-\lambda_i\cdot\lambda_j$ for a real array $(\lambda_1,\dots \lambda_n)$ such that 
$\lambda_1+\dots+\lambda_n=0$.
These inequalities are also known as inequalities of \emph{negative type} \cite{deza-lauren}.
If in the array $(\lambda_1,\dots \lambda_n)$ contains $i$ positive and $j$ negative numbers,
then we say that this is an inequality of \emph{negative type} $(i,j)$.
Since changing the sign of all $\lambda_i$ does not change the inequality, we can always assume that $i\ge j$.

\paragraph{Four-point arrays.}\label{Four-point arrays}
Now suppose that $n=4$.
In this case, we have two interesting types of the rank-one inequalities: $(2,2)$ and $(3,1)$.
The case $(1,1)$ is trivial and 
the case $(2,1)$ follows from the triangle inequality.
In fact the triangle inequality is equivalent to all inequalities of negative type $(2,1)$.

Consider a rank-one inequality $\rho_{\bm{x}}(v)\ge 0$; we may assume that $v$ is a unit vector.
Furthermore, we may assume that it lies in a closed hemisphere bounded by an equator in direction of one of the the facets of $\triangle$.
These equators divide the hemisphere into triangles and quadrangles.
The inequality $\rho_{\bm{x}}(v)\ge 0$ has negative type $(2,2)$ or $(3,1)$
if and only if $v$ lies in the interior of a triangle or a quadrangle, respectfully.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{36mm}
\centering
\vskip-4mm
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-20}
\vskip-0mm
\end{wrapfigure}

If a vector $v$ is parallel to a facet of $\triangle$, then $\rho_{\bm{x}}(v)\ge 0$ is an inequality negative type $(2,1)$, which follows from the triangle inequality.
The picture shows the hemisphere.
The label on edges show which triangle inequality becomes equality if $\rho_{\bm{x}}$ vanish at some vector on this edge;
for example, label $123$ means that
\[|x_1-x_2|+|x_2-x_3|=|x_1-x_3|.\]
If $\rho_{\bm{x}}$ vanish on the intersection of equators, then two points in the array have to coincide;
the label shows which pair.
For example if it is marked by $12$, then $x_1=x_2$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $X$ be a 4-point metric space.

If $X$ satisfies all inequalities of negative type $(3, 1)$, then it admits an isometric embedding into the product $r\cdot \mathbb{S}^1\times\RR^3$ for some $r>0$.

If $X$ satisfies all inequalities of negative type $(2, 2)$, then it admits an isometric embedding into the product $T\times\RR^3$, where $T$ denotes the \emph{tripod};
that is, three half-lines glued along the base points.
\end{thm}

Inequalities of negative type $(3, 1)$ hold in Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature; it follows from the so-called Lang--Schroeder--Sturm inequality \cite{lang-schroeder, sturm}.
Similarly, inequalities of negative type $(2, 2)$ hold in Alexandrov spaces with nonpositive curvature; it follows from \cite[9.5]{AKP-2024}.
Since the tripod $T$ has nonpositive curvature, and $\mathbb{S}^1$ has nonnegative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov, we get the following.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
A 4-point metric space $X$ is isometric to subset in a length space with nonpositive (nonnegative) curvature in the sense of Alexandrov if and only if all inequalities of negative type $(3, 1)$ (respectively, type $(2, 2)$) hold in $X$.
\end{thm}

More general five-point versions of this corollary were already proved by Tetsu Toyoda \cite{toyoda,lebedeva-petrunin2021} and the first two authors \cite{lebedeva-petrunin-2024}, respectively.


\parit{Proof.}
Let us enumerate points in $X$ and let $\rho$ be the associated form on $\RR^3$.
If $\rho\ge 0$, then $X$ is isometric to a 4-point subset in the Euclidean 3-space,
and there is nothing to prove.

Choose a minimal form $\tilde\rho\le \rho$ such that all $(2,1)$ inequalities hold for $\tilde\rho$;
here $\tilde\rho\le \rho$ means that $\tilde\rho(v)\le \rho(v)$ for any vector $v$.
Consider the (semi)metric on $X$ with the associated form $\tilde\rho$; denote by
$\tilde X$ the corresponding metric space.
If $X$ satisfies all inequalities of negative type $(3, 1)$ or $(2,2)$, then so does $\tilde X$.

By the observation in §~\ref{par:rank-one}, $X$ isometrically embeds into $\tilde X\times \RR^3$.
Hence it is sufficient to show that $\tilde X$ embeds into $T$, or, correspondingly, into $r\cdot \mathbb{S}^1$ for some $r>0$.

Let $N\subset \mathbb{S}^2$ be a set where $\tilde\rho$ is negative and let $\bar N$ be its closure.
The set $N$ is nonempty; otherwise we are in the case $\rho\ge 0$, which is already covered.

Since all $(2,1)$-inequalities hold for $\tilde\rho$,
it must be nonnegative in on 4 equators $e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4$ in the directions of facets of $\triangle$.
Since $\tilde\rho$ is minimal, $\bar N$ has to touch $e_i$ at least at 3 directions (up to sign). 
If not, then there is a linear function, say $\ell$, that vanish at all common points of $\bar N$ and $e_i$ for all $i$.
In this case, consider the form $\tilde\rho-\eps\cdot \ell^2$ for small $\eps>0$.
Note that all $(2,1)$-inequalities still hold for this form;
therefore, $\tilde\rho$ is not minimal --- a contradiction.

It means that $\bar N$ lies in a quadrangle or triangle respectively and touches its sides at three points or more.

In the case of triangle, $\bar N$ has to touch all of its sides.
The diagram shows that after relabeling, we can assume that 
\begin{align*}
|x_1-x_2|&=|x_1-x_4|+|x_4-x_2|,
\\
|x_2-x_3|&=|x_2-x_4|+|x_4-x_3|,
\\
|x_3-x_1|&=|x_3-x_4|+|x_4-x_1|.
\end{align*}
In this case the array is embeddable in $T$.

In the case of quadrangle, $\bar N$ touches at least three of its sides (but might touch all four).
The diagram shows that after relabeling, we can assume that 
\begin{align*}
|x_1-x_4|&=|x_1-x_2|+|x_2-x_4|=|x_1-x_3|+|x_3-x_4|,
\\
|x_2-x_3|&=|x_2-x_4|+|x_4-x_3|.
\end{align*}
(If it touches all sides, then in addition we have $|x_2-x_3|=|x_2-x_1|+|x_1-x_3|$.)
In any case, the array is embeddable in $r\cdot \mathbb{S}^1$, where $r=|x_1-x_4|/\pi$.
\qeds

The following picture shows possible positions of the set $N$.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}
Below it we draw a diagram following the convention from \cite{lebedeva-petrunin-2010};
if three points, say $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, uppear in this order on a smooth line, then $|x_1-x_2|+|x_2-x_3|=|x_1-x_3|$.


\paragraph{Alexandrov's comparison.}
In terms of $v$, inequalities of negative type $(2,2)$ means that $v$ points from one edge of $\triangle$ to the opposite edge;
the type $(3,1)$ means that $v$ points from a vertex to the opposite face (or in the opposite direction).

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Suppose $K\subset W$ is defined by one rank-one ineqaulity on four-point arrays.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item If the inequality is of negative type $(2,2)$, then $\mathcal{M}_K$ consists all length spaces with nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
\item If the inequality is of negative type $(3,1)$, then $\mathcal{M}_K$ consists all length spaces with nonnegative curvature in the sense of Alexandrov.
\item In the remaining cases, $\mathcal{M}_K$ consists all length spaces.
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}

The proof is a straightforward combination of the arguments by Takashi Sato \cite{sato} and its variation by the first two authors \cite{lebedeva-petrunin-2010}.
These papers consider particular cases of $(2,2)$ and $(3,1)$ inequalities, namely for $\lambda$-arrays $(1,1,-1,-1)$ and $(1,1,1,-3)$, respectively.

\parit{Proof.}
Our inequality can be written as 
\[\sum_{i,j}\lambda_i\cdot\lambda_j\cdot|x_i-x_j|_X^2\le 0,
\eqlbl{eq:lambda}
\]
where $\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3+\lambda_4=0$.
If $\lambda_i=0$ for some $i$,
then the inequality follows from the triangle inequality.
It means that $\mathcal{M}_K$ consists of all length spaces.

It remains to consider the inequalities of negative type $(2,2)$ or $(3,1)$.
In these cases, we can and will assume that our $\lambda$-array is
\[(\alpha\cdot (1-\beta),\  (1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\beta),\  \beta,\ -1)\] 
for some $\alpha,\beta$ such that $0< \beta< 1$;
in case of $(2,2)$-inequality, $0< \alpha< 1$,
and
in case of $(3,1)$-inequality, $1< \alpha$.

Consider the 4-point array $\bm{x}=(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$  in the plane such that 
\[x_4=\alpha\cdot (1-\beta)\cdot x_1+(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\beta)\cdot x_2+\beta\cdot x_3.\]
We can assume that the array is enumerated so that we have a configuration as on one of the pictures below,
so for $(3,1)$-inequality, point $x_4$ lies inside of triangle $x_1x_2x_3$,
and for $(2,2)$-inequality segment $[x_1,x_3]$ intersects $[x_2,x_4]$.

Note that we get equality in \ref{eq:lambda} for this array.
Moreover, this defines bijection between $\bm{x}$-arrays up to affine transformation and $\lambda$-arrays up to multiplication by a nonzero coefficient;
as before, we assume that the $\bm{x}$-arrays are in general position --- three of its points do not lie on one line.
So we can describe our inequality by a 4-point array in general position.
If the points of the array lie in a vertices of a convex quadrangle,
then it corresponds to an inequalities of type $(2,2)$.
If one of the points in the array lie inside of the triangle formed by the remaining points, then it corresponds to an inequalities of type $(3,1)$.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\vskip-0mm
\centering
\includegraphics{mppics/pic-10}
\vskip0mm
\end{figure}

Consider the affine transformation that sends $x_1\mapsto x_1$, $x_2\mapsto x_2$ and $x_3\mapsto x_4$;
let $x_5$ be the image of $x_4$ under this transformation; so \begin{align*}
x_5&=\alpha\cdot (1-\beta)\cdot x_1+(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\beta)\cdot x_2+\beta\cdot x_4=
\\
&=\alpha\cdot (1-\beta^2)\cdot x_1+(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\beta^2)\cdot x_2+\beta^2\cdot x_3.
\end{align*}
Note that $x_4$ lies between $x_3$ and $x_5$;
in particular $|x_3-x_4|+|x_4-x_5|=|x_3-x_5|$.

Consider the inequalities of type \ref{eq:lambda} that corresponds to array $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ and $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_5$;
let us call them first and second.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Suppose that the first inequality holds for any four-point array in a length space $X$, then so does the second inequality.
\end{thm}

Indeed, passing to the ultracompletion, we may assume that $X$ is geodesic.
Choose 4 points $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_5\in X$ and let $x_4$ be a point on a geodesic $[x_3,x_5]$ that divides it in the same ratio as in the 5-point configuration in the plane.
If we sum up the first inequality for arrays $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$ and $x_1,x_2,x_4,x_5$ with an appropriate coefficient, then we get the second inequality for $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_5$.

By the claim, the intequality for $\lambda$-array $(\alpha\cdot (1-\beta),(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\beta), \beta,-1)$ implies the inequality for the $\lambda$-array $(\alpha\cdot (1-\beta^2), (1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\beta^2), \beta^2,-1)$.
Iterating the procedure, we get all the inequalities with $\lambda$-arrays
\[(\alpha\cdot (1-\delta),\  (1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\delta),\ \delta,\ -1)\]
for $\delta=\beta^{2^n}$ with any integer $n\ge 1$;
in particular, we get the following inequality
\[
\begin{aligned}
\alpha\cdot (1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\delta)^2\cdot|x_1-x_2|^2 - \delta\cdot |x_3-x_4|^2 &+
\\
+(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\delta)\cdot\delta\cdot|x_2-x_3|^2-\alpha\cdot (1-\delta)\cdot |x_1-x_4|^2&+
\\
+\alpha\cdot(1-\delta)\cdot\delta\cdot|x_1-x_3|^2-(1-\alpha)\cdot(1-\delta)\cdot |x_2-x_4|^2&\le 0
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:lambda-inq}
\]
arbitrarily small $\delta>0$.

Choose $X\in \mathcal{M}_K$.
Let us apply the corresponding ineqaulity

\end{figure}
a quadruple $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4\in X$ such that $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_4$ lie on one geodesic and we have equalitiy in the $(2,1)$-inequality with $\lambda$-array
\[(\alpha,\  (1-\alpha),\ 0,\ -1);\]
that is,
\[\alpha\cdot (1-\alpha)\cdot|x_1-x_2|^2-\alpha\cdot |x_1-x_4|^2-(1-\alpha)\cdot |x_2-x_4|^2=0.\eqlbl{eq:trig-inq}\]

%\\
%+\alpha\cdot(1-\delta)\cdot|x_1-x_3|^2+(1-\alpha)\cdot |x_2-x_4|^2&\le 0.

%Since $\delta>0$ can be taken arbitrary small, we get
%\[
%\begin{aligned}
%-2\cdot \alpha\cdot (1-\alpha)\cdot|x_1-x_2|^2 -  |x_3-x_4|^2 &+

%\\
%+\alpha\cdot|x_1-x_3|^2+(1-\alpha)\cdot |x_2-x_4|^2&\le 0.
%\end{aligned}
%\]
%Adding two \ref{eq:trig-inq} to the last inequality, we get

Passing to the limit $\delta\to 0$ in the inequality \ref{eq:trig-inq}$\,+\,\tfrac1\delta\cdot($\ref{eq:lambda-inq}$\,-\,$\ref{eq:trig-inq}$)$, we get
\[
\begin{aligned}
|x_3-x_4|^2&\ge
(1-\alpha)\cdot|x_3-x_2|^2+\alpha\cdot|x_3-x_1|^2-
\\
&-(1-\alpha)\cdot |x_4-x_2|^2-\alpha\cdot|x_4-x_1|^2.
\end{aligned}
\eqlbl{eq:CBB-CBA}
\]
Recall that nonnegative or nonpositive curvature in the sense of Alexandrov is defined via this inequality for all $\alpha\in (0,1)$ and $\alpha\in (1,\infty)$, respectively.
So far we get it only for one value of $\alpha$, but iterating this inequality we get it for the remaining values.

More presisely, assume this inequality holds for some $\alpha\in (0,1)$, then appying iteration we can choose $\alpha$ from the follwing nimbers: $(1-\alpha)$, $\alpha^2$,  $\alpha\cdot (1-\alpha)$, $(1-\alpha)^2$, and so on.
Together with any value $\xi$, this set contains $\alpha\cdot \xi$ and $(1-\alpha)\cdot\xi$.
Note that this set is dense in $(0,1)$.
Therefore, inequality \ref{eq:CBB-CBA} holds for any $\alpha\in (0,1)$; the latter is equivalent to the point-on-side comparison for nonnegative curvature; see \cite[8.14]{AKP-2024}.
Similarly one can show that if the inequality holds for some $\alpha>1$, then it holds for any $\alpha>1$,
and this is equivalent to the point-on-side comparison for nonpositive curvature; see \cite[9.14]{AKP-2024}.

\paragraph{Globalization.}\label{par:globalization}
Suppose $K\subset W$ is closed convex cone.
We say that a metric space $X$ meets \emph{local $K$-comparison} if any point $x\in X$ admits a neighborhood $U$ such that $K$-comparison for any $n$-point array in $U$.

If local $K$-comparison implies $K$-comparison for any length space, then we say that \emph{globalization holds} for the $K$-comparison.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Suppose that globalization holds for the $K$-comparison for for some closed cone $K\subset W=\RR^3$.
Then $\mathcal{M}_K$ consists of all Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
In the assumption of the theorem, $\mathcal{M}_K$ contains all Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Suppose $K\ne\{0\}$.
By the proposition in § \ref{Associated form}, $\mathcal{M}_K$ contrains real line.
Therefore, local $K$-comparison holds for any circle $r\cdot \mathbb{S}^1$, and any prduct space $r\cdot \mathbb{S}^1\times\RR^3$ for any $r>0$.
It remains to apply the proposition in §~\ref{Four-point arrays}.
\qeds

\parit{Proof of the theorem.}
So far we have problem here, but hopefully it will be resolved.
\qeds

\paragraph{Remarks.}
The requiremnt that the cone $K$ is closed in §~\ref{par:globalization} is necessary;
without it, the globalization holds for the cone described by inequality
\[|x_1-x_2|^2+|x_1-x_3|^2+|x_2-x_3|^2<4\cdot(|x_1-x_4|^2+|x_2-x_4|^2+|x_3-x_4|^2).\]
To check the statement note and use that this ineqaulity forbids tripods.

It would be super-nice to find a quadratic inequality for $n$-point array that is essentailly different from the globalization theorem.
Some canditates can be found in our earlier paper \cite{lebedeva-petrunin-zolotov}.
Also it might be possible to prove an analog of our globalization theorem for simply connected spaces; which includes Cartan--Hadamrd theorem.
